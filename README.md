## 🔭 Project Overview

**IceMart** is a multi-actor e-commerce platform that supports three user roles — **Customer**, **Seller**, and **Admin** — each with a dedicated interface and set of capabilities. The platform uses **localStorage** as its data persistence layer, making it a fully client-side application with no backend dependency.

The application features a custom icy/neon-themed UI with animated snowfall effects, a modular JavaScript architecture using ES6 modules, and reusable HTML partials loaded dynamically at runtime. Seed data is loaded from JSON files on first visit.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement & Objectives

### Problem Statement

Traditional e-commerce platforms require complex backend systems to manage products, users, and orders. This project aims to simulate a simplified version of such a system using only front-end technologies, while maintaining role-based access control and structured data handling.

### Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to build a responsive e-commerce system that:

- Supports multiple user roles (Customer, Seller, Admin) with distinct interfaces and permissions
- Implements authentication simulation with secure login, registration, and role-based redirection
- Allows product browsing, searching, filtering, and purchasing with a full checkout flow
- Provides dedicated dashboards for sellers (product management) and admins (platform oversight)
- Stores all data locally without backend integration using localStorage and JSON seed files
- Builds a responsive, themed UI that works across desktop and mobile devices

---

## 🖥️ System Overview

The system is fully client-side and runs entirely in the browser. There is no backend server or real database. All data operations happen through JavaScript interacting with the browser's localStorage API.

- **JSON files** serve as the mock database, providing seed data for products and users on first visit
- **localStorage** persists all runtime data including users, products, orders, cart, wishlist, reviews, messages, and admin logs
- **JavaScript (ES6 Modules)** handles authentication simulation, dynamic content rendering, state management, and all user interactions
- **HTML Partials** are loaded dynamically to maintain consistent navigation and footer across all pages

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔐 **Role-Based Authentication** — Secure login and registration with role selection (Customer, Seller, Admin), input validation with regex, password strength enforcement, international phone input, and automatic role-based redirection.
- 🛡️ **Auth Guards & Route Protection** — Pages check for authenticated users and correct roles on load. Unauthorized users are automatically redirected, preventing direct URL access to restricted areas.
- 🧭 **Dynamic Navbar** — Navigation adapts based on user role — showing/hiding admin panel and seller dashboard links, hiding the cart icon for admins, displaying welcome messages, and toggling login/logout buttons.
- 👤 **User Profile Management** — View and edit personal information (name, phone, address) with validation. View order history with status tracking and navigate to detailed order breakdowns.
- 🛍️ **Product Catalog with Multi-Filter System** — Filter by category, brand, price range (dual sliders with dynamic range adjustment), and keyword search. All filters compose together and update in real time.
- 📄 **Pagination with URL State Management** — Client-side pagination synced with URL query parameters, so page state survives refresh and supports shareable links.
- 💰 **Discount System** — Percentage-based discounts with crossed-out original prices and highlighted sale prices throughout catalog, details, cart, and wishlist.
- 🛒 **Per-User Cart with Stock Validation** — Each user has an isolated cart. Stock limits are enforced on add, quantity increase, and checkout.
- 🔴 **Real-Time Cart & Wishlist Badges** — Navbar icons display live count badges that update immediately on any change.
- ❤️ **Wishlist Functionality** — Per-user wishlist with add/remove, move to cart, clear all with confirmation, and login-required modal for guests.
- ⭐ **Product Reviews & Ratings** — Submit star ratings and text reviews. Review summary with star distribution bars generated dynamically. Product ratings recalculate based on submissions.
- 🖼️ **Product Image Gallery** — Main image with clickable thumbnail gallery for multiple product angles.
- 📦 **Checkout & Order Placement** — Full checkout with shipping info, payment selection (COD, Visa, MasterCard), card validation, tax/shipping calculation, and order confirmation.
- 📬 **Contact Form with Admin Message Viewer** — Validated contact form saves messages to localStorage. Admin panel has a dedicated messages section with search, pagination, and detail modal.
- 🏷️ **Category Navigation from Homepage** — Clicking category cards navigates to catalog with that category pre-filtered via URL parameters.
- 👨‍💼 **Admin Dashboard & Analytics** — KPI cards, revenue chart (7D/30D toggle), order status chart, user growth chart, top revenue products, and activity timeline.
- 👥 **Admin User Management** — Search, filter, toggle status, reset passwords, view details, and delete users with protection for main admin.
- 📋 **Admin Product Moderation** — Approve, reject, feature products. Bulk actions with select-all and batch updates.
- 📦 **Admin Order Management** — View, filter, search, cancel orders with confirmation, and navigate to order details.
- 🏪 **Seller Dashboard** — Product management (add, edit, delete with Base64 image upload), stats, revenue charts, order tables, and top product widget.
- 🔔 **Toast Notifications** — Non-blocking toast messages with type variants (success, warning, error) across all modules.
- 📱 **Responsive Design** — Mobile-friendly with collapsible sidebar, responsive grids, and Bootstrap breakpoints.
- 💾 **localStorage-Based Data Persistence** — All data persists in the browser. Seed data loads from JSON on first visit.

- 🧩 **Reusable HTML Partials** — Navbar, footer, and back button loaded dynamically via custom include.js loader.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Patterns

### Modular JavaScript (ES6 Modules)
The application uses native JavaScript ES6 modules (`import`/`export`) to separate concerns. Each page or feature has its own module file, and shared logic lives in the `core/` directory.

### Dynamic Partial Loading
A custom `include.js` loader fetches HTML partials (navbar, footer) at runtime and injects them into the DOM, then dynamically imports associated JavaScript modules. This keeps the navbar and footer consistent across all pages without duplication.

### Single-Page Admin Panel
The admin panel uses a single HTML page (`admin-panel.html`) with multiple `<section>` elements that are shown/hidden dynamically. A sidebar menu triggers `switchSection()` which renders the appropriate module — Dashboard, Users, Products, Orders, or Messages.

### State Management via localStorage
All application state (users, products, orders, cart, wishlist, reviews, contact messages, admin logs) is stored in `localStorage`. Seed data from JSON files is loaded on first visit if no existing data is found.

### URL-Driven State
The catalog page syncs filter state (category, page number) with URL query parameters using `window.history.replaceState()`. This enables bookmarkable, shareable, and refresh-safe filter states.
